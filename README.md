# Real-Time API Data Integration & Automation (Live Data)
### Built a real-time, automated Power BI dashboard that visualizes global development indicators using live data from the World Development Indicators API. 
Developed end-to-end Python pipelines to continuously fetch, clean, and transform API data into structured datasets, which were integrated into Power BI for analysis. 
This solution combines Python,  APIs, and Power BI to deliver continuous monitoring of key global development indicators such as GDP, trade, health expenditure, internet penetration, unemployment, and poverty trends.
## multi-layer analytical
### Economic Baselines: Average GDP per capita, trade value, forest area, and healthcare spending across countries.

Regional Health Investment Patterns: Comparing health expenditure (% of GDP) across world regions to uncover inequalities.

Time-Series Indicator Trends: Tracking how GDP, unemployment, renewable energy use, and digital adoption evolve over time.

Digital Access Impact: Evaluating how internet penetration influences immunization awareness and unemployment reduction.

Development Performance: Identifying the top/bottom 10 countries in poverty reduction to guide future policy and NGO interventions.

Health Indicator Correlations: Studying relationships among life expectancy, health spending, immunization rates, and child mortality.
