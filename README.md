# Real-Time API Data Integration & Automation (Live Data)
### Built a real-time, automated Power BI dashboard that visualizes global development indicators using live data from the World Development Indicators API. 
Developed end-to-end Python pipelines to continuously fetch, clean, and transform API data into structured datasets, which were integrated into Power BI for analysis. 
This solution combines Python,  APIs, and Power BI to deliver continuous monitoring of key global development indicators such as GDP, trade, health expenditure, internet penetration, unemployment, and poverty trends.

## 🔍 Key Features
  + **Real-Time API Integration :** Python script automates continuous data extraction and transformation.

  + **Live Power BI Dashboard:** Automatically updates whenever new API data is available.

  + **Advanced Data Modeling:** Cleaned, structured, and optimized datasets for multi-dimensional analysis.

  + **Multi-Domain Insights:**

     + Global GDP, trade, and economic performance
     + Health expenditure comparisons across world regions
     + Time-series trends in technology, environment, and employment
     + Internet penetration impact on immunization and unemployment
  + **Policy & Development Focus:**
  
       + Identify the bottom 10 countries struggling with poverty reduction**
       + Highlight top 10 best-performing nations
       + Analyze correlations between health indicators such as life expectancy, immunization, child mortality, and healthcare spending

This project demonstrates how data automation, live dashboards, and global development analytics can come together to support decision-making for policymakers, NGOs, and international development teams.
## Multi-Layer analytical Dashboard
  **multi-layer analytical dashboard that answers high-impact global development questions, including:**
 + **Economic Baselines:** Average GDP per capita, trade value, forest area, and healthcare spending across countries.
+ **Regional Health Investment Patterns:** Comparing health expenditure (% of GDP) across world regions to uncover inequalities.
+ **Time-Series Indicator Trends:** Tracking the evolution of GDP, unemployment, renewable energy use, and digital adoption over time.

+ **Digital Access Impact:** Examining the Influence of Internet Penetration on Immunization Awareness and Unemployment Reduction.

+ **Development Performance:** Identifying the top/bottom 10 countries in poverty reduction to guide future policy and NGO interventions.

+ **Health Indicator Correlations:** Studying relationships among life expectancy, health spending, immunization rates, and child mortality.

## Project Workflow
     1. API Extraction with Python
        - Uses requests library to pull data from the World Development Indicators API.
     2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
        - Cleaning missing values and inconsistent formats and merging multiple indicator datasets.
     3. Live Data Integration with Power BI
        - Power BI connected to Python script.
     4. Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
        - DAX measures for averages, growth rates, comparisons, and correlations.

## 📊 Dashboard Analysis Includes:
+ Average GDP per capita, GDP growth, health spending, trade value.
+ Forest land analysis.
+ Trends in indicators (2016–2024).
+ Internet penetration vs unemployment.
+ Internet penetration vs immunization.
+ Top 10 & Bottom 10 poverty-reduction countries.
+ Correlation heatmap of health indicators.
+ Health expenditure vs life expectancy regression analysis.

## 📡 Core Features & Capabilities
1️⃣ **Real-Time API Integration**
    + 100% automated data refresh using Python
    + Pulls global indicators (GDP, health, poverty, technology, trade, etc.)
    + Covers countries, updated directly from a public API
    + Eliminates manual downloading, cleaning, or uploading

2️⃣ **Economic Intelligence (GDP, Trade, Finance)**
   + Tracks high-impact economic metrics:
   + GDP per Capita 
   + Trade (% of GDP)
   + Health Expenditure (ranges from 2% to 17% across regions)
   + Forest Area (% of land)


3️⃣ **Social & Health Development Analysis**

Includes  human development indicators:
 + Life expectancy
 + Child mortality
 + Immunization rates
 + Government health spending

**Poverty levels**

📌 Top 10 countries in poverty reduction identified
📌 Bottom 10 struggling countries highlighted for NGO intervention

4️⃣ **Internet Usage Impact Analysis (Digital → Development Link)**

This project analyzes how internet penetration influences development outcomes using real data.

📈 Internet → Immunization
Countries with >70% internet penetration show:
12–18% higher childhood immunization rates

## 🤝 Business + Social Impact
This dashboard supports:
 + NGOs designing development programs
 + Governments evaluating economic strategy
 + Public health teams measuring progress
 + Global organizations (UN, WHO, World Bank)
 + Researchers studying inequalities
Goal: Enable data-driven decisions that improve social, health, and economic outcomes globally.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
